# AI-ChatBot-
Building a chatbot can sound daunting, but it’s totally doable. IKY is an AI powered conversational dialog interface built in Python.
With IKY it’s easy to create Natural Language conversational scenarios with no coding efforts whatsoever. 
The smooth UI makes it effortless to create and train conversations to the bot and it continuously gets smarter as
it learns from conversations it has with people. IKY can live on any channel of your choice (such as Messenger, Slack etc.)
by integrating it’s API with that platform.  You don’t need to be an expert at artificial intelligence to create an awesome 
chatbot that has artificial intelligence. With this basic project you can create an artificial intelligence powered chatting
machine in no time.There may be scores of bugs. So feel free to contribute via pull requests.
